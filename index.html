      <h1>Crater Lake National Park</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="headerText clearfix">
      <p>Today, Crater Lake national park in western Oregon is known for having one of the deepest, clearest lakes in the world, but 7,700 years ago, the landscape stunned witnesses for a different reason: the eruption of the Mount Mazama volcano, which created Crater Lake, is thought to be one of the greatest geologic catastrophes ever witnessed by humans. After it erupted, Mount Mazama collapsed, leaving behind a crater more than 1,200 metres deep – and 8km north to south and 10km east to west – that eventually filled with rain and snowmelt.</p>
      <p>Along the crest of a line of volcanoes known as the Oregon Cascades, Crater Lake is a winter sports playground. Summer visitors should plan to circumnavigate the lake on the 53km loop road, which skirts the edge of the crater – or hike down to the water on the 3.5km Cleetwood Cove trail. Accommodation is available at the Crater Lake Lodge or at two campsites (reservations recommended). Backcountry camping is also allowed along the Pacific Crest trail, which runs through the park on its way from Mexico to Canada.</p>

      <h2>What To Do at Crater Lake:</h2>

          <h3>Cleetwood Cove Trail</h3>
          <p>This is the only trail that will take you to the water, and is a beautiful hike. The trail is wide and switchbacks down 700 feet and 1.1 miles down to the boat docks. There are some benches along the way and beautiful views. At the bottom, there is a bathroom and a rock you can jump off of into the cold water, for a unique, Crater Lake experience. The walk back up is a real workout, but is not a problem if you take your time.</p>

          <h3>Toketee Falls</h3>
          <p>With the abundance of waterfalls in Oregon it is definitely a challenge to rate which are the best, but after hiking to the many different waterfalls that we have visited we both definitely agree that this is one of the best. It isn't only the waterfall that makes this place so special. The trail to the falls follows the river and affords some spectacular views along the way. There are a few very short trails that break off from the main trail that give amazing views of the river and some awesome rock formations.</p>

          <h3>Wizard Island</h3>
          <p>Wizard Island is the big island in the middle of Crater Lake in Crater Lake National Park. My husband and I visited Crater Lake National Park on a Sunday. The water is a beautiful blue in the lake and around the Wizard Island. Be aware Crater Lake National Park is extreme crowded on the weekends, even in September. Rim Drive becomes one lane in many places after lunch because people are parking in the road, and that is because the parking lots full up.</p>
